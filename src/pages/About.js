                    Green Flag was founded by two high school students called Aashish Anantharaman and Shreyank Kulkarni
                    with the goal of helping homeowners navigating the process of incorporating green energy practices into their homes.

                    By creating a blog filled with general information as well as resources tailoring to specific needs,
                    Green Flag aims to provide homeowners with the tools they need to make informed decisions about their energy practices.
